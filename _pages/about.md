## 🔥 My Take on Tech 💡  

💡 **Not-So-Hot Take:**  
_"If you're skilled in the terminal, you can use almost any Linux distro. The main differences are the package manager and default DE. There are exceptions, but in most cases, it's unnoticeable."_  

🔥 **Hot Take:**  
> *“A computer is like air conditioning – it becomes useless when you open Windows.”*  
> ~ Linus Torvalds  

> *"Self-hosting is the only real way if you want privacy."*  
> ~ Giu

🚀 **Keep exploring, keep tinkering, and never stop learning!** 🛠️🔥
